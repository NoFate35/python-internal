# About project
In this course, I gained a deeper understanding of classes in Python. I learned about the Liskov substitution principle, different types of methods, and the "template method" pattern. I also learned how to write code effectively by understanding the features of OOP in Python. The knowledge gained from this course will help me make informed decisions about inheritance and composition, as well as improve my code using metaclasses.
### Topics to be considered:
* Properly choose between inheritance and composition
* Follow the Liskov substitution principle when building class hierarchies
* Reduce duplication using traits and abstract classes
* Implement the "template method" pattern
* Write code effectively by understanding how OOP works in Python
### Installation
The __poetry__ project manager must be installed to work with the project
```
git clone https://github.com/NoFate35/python-internal.git
cd python-internal
poetry install
make test
```
The tests should be run for each folder separately, like:
```
poetry run pytest exceptions -vv
```
